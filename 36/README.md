# PasswordRunes36 (Chaos Runes)

Out of 120 patterns that form PasswordRunes60 48 posess an axial symmetry. The remaining 72 may be arrange in pairs of mirror images.
When mirror images are placed on the opposite side of the same tile the dots may be represented as through holes. This greatly simplifies
laser cutting (no need to etch on both sides or gluing together two separate halves) or 3d printing.

Having holes in place of colors opens up other interesting possibilities, such as mechanical ways of detection.
